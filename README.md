## Project1 - Typography

The goal of this project was to create an interactive typeface. I decided to go for a nostalgic CRT Screen. You can turn the screen on and off by pressing the Red button, and change channels with the gray buttons.

The color of the first typeface can be changed by clicking with the mouse. By moving the mouse to the right, you can also change the movement speed of the pixels. 
The second typeface can display text you type on your keyboard. By pressing ENTER, you can delete everything. Moving the mouse to the right adds a bigger wave movement. 


## Project - Micro-Interactions

The goal of the second project was to create a  "misuse." I decided to design sliders that change the background color. 

The task is to set the background to green, but it's impossible because all the sliders start to move when one is touched.
